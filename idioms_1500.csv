It'll be a slam dunk

slower than molasses
don't worry it's small beer
small fry
small potatoes
smell a rat
smoking gun

snake oil
selling snake oil
let's get a sneak peek
soak up the sun
you were sold on it
some eggs
your fingerprints are all over it
it to crow
well son of a gun
it was definitely a sore point
nothing more than sour grapes
sour grapes
spare the rod and spoil the child
speak of the devil and he shall appear
speak with a plum in your mouth
spick and span
spill the beans
spin a yarn
spin your wheels
spit into the wind
spoiling for a fight
he is spoiling for a fight
square the circle
stab him  in the back
stalking horse
stand him in good stead
stand on your own two feet
stand your ground
start with a clean slate
steal you thunder
stem the tide
step up your game
step up to the plate
stick it to the man
stick your nose into it
suffering from sticker shock
stick-in-the-mud
sticky wicket
stiff-necked
just a storm in a teacup
stormy relationship
quite a stumbling block
straight arrow
strain at a gnat and swallow a camel
strike a chord
will be your sugar daddy
a sure-fire way
swan song
swan song
sweep under the carpet
sweep it under the rug
sweet dreams!
something to sweeten the deal
sweeten the pot
swim against the tide
swim with sharks
swim with the fishes
swing for the fences
swinging for the fences
sword of damocles
take him to the cleaners
let's take a deep dive into it
take a flyer
take a gander
take a hike
take a powder
take a rain check
take five you need a break
take five
take it easy
take it easy
take it easy
thanks for taking it on the chin
take it or leave it
take him to task
better take it with a grain of salt
that really takes the cake
something to take the edge off 
pleading the fifth
take the gloves off
take the high road
take the piss out of him 
take the shine off it
take the starch out of him
take the wind out of your sails
take your life in your hands
take your medicine
"No rush, take your time"
getting a taste of your own medicine
teach an old dog new tricks
don't tear your hair out over this
a real tear-jerker of an ending
tee many martoonies
"Yeah right, tell it to the marines"
just a tempest in a teapot
"ten a penny, give a penny"
I'll bet you ten to one
testing the waters
shall we test the waters first?
That's when they finally tied the knot
tighten the screws on 'em
no need to be so tight-lipped about it
til the cows come home
time is money
just the tip of the iceberg
I guess you didn't mean to tip to your hand
with a little tender loving care
to be a peach
being smitten with him 
to be you one and only
to be the apple of you eye
It will eventually bear fruit
it did eventually bear fruit
shall we carpool it
to each his own
I hope you don notget cold feet
to have a chip on your shoulder
to have butterflies in your stomach
to have one for the road
to pay an arm and a leg
time to pop your cherry
to pull you leg
runs hot and cold on you
following it to the letter
towing the line
tone-deaf
tongue-in-cheek
too busy fighting alligators to drain the swamp
too many cooks spoil the broth
too many chiefs and not enough indians
too many to shake a stick at
toot your own horn
top banana
tossing a wrench into it
touch base
touch your heart
touch water
tough cookie
tough cookie
tough sledding
turn a blind eye to it
turn on a dime
turn him inside out
Let's turn it on its head
turn turtle
we're finally turning the corner
turn the tables
turnabout is fair play
twenty-four seven
twisting the knife in deeper
twist the knife in deeper
"two a penny, three a penny"
two peas in a pod
thank god it is Friday
I am afraid that ship has sailed
that's music to my ears
that's quite a stretch
And that's all she wrote
the apple never falls far from the tree
the birds and the bees
the cat is out of the bag
the coast is clear
the cherry on the cake
looks like the deck is stacked against you
sorry the jig is up
"the more things change, the more they stay the same"
the only game in town
the powers that be
the real mccoy
this story has legs
the time is ripe for it
the walls have ears we
the walls have ears
the whole enchilada
the whole shebang
the world is your oyster
there but for the grace of god go i
there's more than one way to skin a cat
there's no such thing as a free lunch
thin on the ground
It's time we think big
think outside the box
think tank
think tank
Watch out near that third rail
third time's a charm
thirty-thousand-foot view
I'd say this has you written all over it
this is not your father's
three sheets to the wind
heard through the grapevine
through thick and thin
throw a wet blanket on it
throw a wrench int
throwing caution to the wind
throw down the gauntlet
throw elbows
time to throw in the towel
throw him  for a loop
throw him  under the bus
throw the baby out with the bath water
throw the baby out with the bath water
throw the book at him
sorry the jig is up
throw the game
throw the match
giving it the thumbs-up
train wreck
trash talk
just treading water
trial balloon
trip the light fantastic
doing a u turn
ugly duckling
flying under the radar
under you spell
under the impression
under the table
under the weather
under the weather
under wraps
in the university of life
until the cows come home
until you're blue in the face
up a creek
it's up for grabs
up for grabs
all up in arms about it
up in the air
you'll be up to your neck
up to scratch
isn't quite up to snuff
let's up the ante
up the duff
upset the apple cart
use your head why don't you
vale of tears
vicious circle
taking a victory lap
virgin territory
vote with your feet
waiting in the wings
waka-jumping
wake up and smell the coffee
wake up on the wrong side of the bed
walk on eggshells
walk the plank
has a wandering eye
wandering eye
I washed my hands of it
water under the bridge
watering hole
a weekend warrior
we will cross that bridge when we come to it
welch on a deal
wet behind the ears
wet behind the ears
throughing a wet blanket on i
wet your whistle:
what do you make of him?
what goes around comes around
what's good for the goose is good for the gander
when hell freezes over
"when in doubt, leave it ou"
"when in rome, do as the romans do"
"when it rains, it pours"
when pigs fly
when the chips are down
where the rubber meets the road
"where there's a will, there's a way"
"where there's smoke, there's fire"
whisper sweet nothings
whispering sweet nothings in your ear
whistle in the dark
whistle past the graveyard
whistling dixie
white elephant
"who's she, the cat's mother?"
wild goose chase
just window dressing
window shop
witch hunt
I'll be there with bells on
work your fingers to the bone
worn to a frazzle
wouldn't be caught dead
you saw the writing on the wall
"year in, year out"
"you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink"
you can say that again!
you can take it to the bank
you can't judge a book by its cover
you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs
you can't make fish of one and fowl of the other
you know the drill
"you snooze, you lose"
young at heart
your guess is as good as mine
your mileage may vary
your number is up
you're driving me nuts
yours truly
zero in on it
zig when one should be zagging
zip your lip
like killing a fly with a sledgehammer
back in the saddle again
